      <p class="Introduction">
        Trees are a vital part of our planetâ€™s ecosystem.
        We all rely on trees and their products: <span class="Trees-benefits"> oxygen, fruits, wood, water,
          medicines and soil nutrients </span> to name a few. </br></br>
        They not only give life, but they also improve livelihoods.
        We often take trees for granted but can you imagine what the world
        would look like without them?
